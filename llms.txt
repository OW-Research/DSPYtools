# Project Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to provide tools (DBGEN and QGEN) for generating database populations and executable query texts for the TPC-H benchmark, which is used to evaluate the performance of decision support systems.

# Key Concepts
- DBGEN
- QGEN
- TPC-H benchmark
- data generation
- query generation
- ANSI C
- command line options
- database population
- SQL syntax
- performance benchmarking

# Architecture Overview
The architecture consists of two main components: DBGEN, which generates the data files required for the TPC-H benchmark, and QGEN, which creates executable SQL queries based on templates. Both components are written in ANSI C for portability and can be built using a makefile. The generated data and queries are used to evaluate the performance of database systems under the TPC-H benchmark specifications.

# Development Information
To set up the development environment, ensure that you have a C compiler and the necessary build tools installed. The project can be built using the provided makefiles, which may include specific targets for different configurations. The README file should provide additional context on how to run the project and any dependencies that need to be installed. Testing scripts are available in the `tests` directory to validate the functionality of the code.

# Usage Examples
1. To generate a database population for the TPC-H benchmark using DBGEN, you can run the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   ./dbgen -s 1.0
   ```
   This command will create a dataset with a scale factor of 1.0.

2. To generate a specific SQL query using QGEN, you can execute:
   ```
   ./qgen -q 1 -f query1.sql
   ```
   This will generate the SQL text for query 1 and save it to the file `query1.sql`.

3. If you want to customize the output of DBGEN with specific command line options, you might use:
   ```
   ./dbgen -s 10.0 -b -v
   ```
   Here, `-b` enables the generation of a binary output, and `-v` provides verbose output during the generation process.
