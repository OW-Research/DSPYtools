This functionality is not tailored to a specific discipline; however, extensions will be explored to meet particular needs. It focuses on managing data-intensive workflows. The two main objectives of the proposal are: to develop software that meets the needs of scientists and to design an architecture that enables the software to scale at a national level.",

      "content": "The working hypothesis of the project postulates that the existing infrastructure related to software, computation, and data is not utilized to its fullest potential; that is, it is not as widely known or employed by researchers and practitioners as it logically should be. Furthermore, we propose that this underutilization of data stems from two primary factors: first, there is a significant lack of metadata which would elucidate the semantics and context of the data, making it difficult for users to understand its relevance and applications; second, there is insufficient adoption of modern data formats that could greatly enhance data reusability across different platforms and research initiatives. In regard to software, the issues are primarily attributed to dependency conflicts\u2014wherein one software package requires another in order to function properly\u2014as well as broader implementation challenges that arise during the software development lifecycle. These challenges are exacerbated by the fact that a considerable amount of scientific software is often created without the implementation of version control or adherence to other best practices in software engineering, which can lead to complications in maintenance and usability.\n\nOn the computational front, which encompasses existing clusters and similar resources, the barriers to effective usage can be categorized into two main issues: first, a lack of awareness among scientists regarding the availability and capabilities of these resources, and second, a scarcity of supporting expertise in computing resources, which limits the ability of researchers to leverage these tools effectively. The Principal Investigator (PI) and co-Principal Investigator (co-PI) have already conducted preliminary interviews with various individuals engaged in the field of scientific computing; however, this initial evidence is deemed insufficient to draw broad conclusions, highlighting the necessity for further investigation to ascertain whether these observations hold true across a wider demographic. One of the central tasks of this project is to rigorously test these hypotheses to gather more conclusive data. Should our hypotheses be validated through our research, we intend to construct our category I proposal around the creation and development of innovative tools and methods designed to address and rectify these identified issues. Conversely, if our hypotheses are not supported by the findings, we will pivot our focus towards developing alternative explanations for the primary challenges currently confronting scientific computing in the United States.",

      "content": "To gather requirements for scalable software tools that facilitate large-scale collaboration, any tools developed during a Category I proposal must meet certain criteria. First, they should facilitate data and workflow sharing, ensuring that tools are designed for effective data sharing, version control, and integration between institutions, which promotes collaboration and transparency. Second, it is essential to generate metadata, including lineage and provenance. Datasets must be annotated with descriptive information about their origin and any preparation done, such as cleaning, to be considered for reuse by scientists beyond the original creators. Third, the tools should include workflow management capabilities, helping scientists create, track, and execute complex data analysis pipelines, and integrate them with popular scientific workflows and platforms. Finally, it is crucial to identify architectures that can scale. Even if suitable tools exist to address all identified needs, they must be integrated into a coherent architecture that maximizes resource utilization and facilitates collaboration and coordination among multiple working groups distributed across the country.",
