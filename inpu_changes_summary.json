      "original": "The working hypothesis of the project is that existing infrastructure (at the level of software, computation, and data) is not as widely known and used as it could and should be. Further, we hypothesize that for data, this is due to: lack of metadata that explains the semantics of the data; and lack of use of modern data formats that would facilitate data reuse. for software, this is due to problems with dependencies (i.e. when a software package requires another software package for running) and implementation issues. This in turn is due to the fact that some scientific software is developed without version control or other software engineering best practices. for computation (i.e. existing clusters and similar resources), this is due to either lack of awareness among scientists; or lack of resources (in the form of computing experts support) to make effective use of the resources. The PI and co-PI have already interviewed some people working in scientific computing, but this provides only limited evidence, so there is a need to check whether these observations generalize. One of the main tasks of this project is to test these hypotheses. If they are validated, we will build our category I proposal around the development of tools and methods to address these issues. If they are not validated, we will seek to develop alternative hypotheses about the main issues facing scientific computing in the United States nowadays.",
      "edited": "The working hypothesis of the project postulates that the existing infrastructure related to software, computation, and data is not utilized to its fullest potential; that is, it is not as widely known or employed by researchers and practitioners as it logically should be. Furthermore, we propose that this underutilization of data stems from two primary factors: first, there is a significant lack of metadata which would elucidate the semantics and context of the data, making it difficult for users to understand its relevance and applications; second, there is insufficient adoption of modern data formats that could greatly enhance data reusability across different platforms and research initiatives. In regard to software, the issues are primarily attributed to dependency conflicts\u2014wherein one software package requires another in order to function properly\u2014as well as broader implementation challenges that arise during the software development lifecycle. These challenges are exacerbated by the fact that a considerable amount of scientific software is often created without the implementation of version control or adherence to other best practices in software engineering, which can lead to complications in maintenance and usability.\n\nOn the computational front, which encompasses existing clusters and similar resources, the barriers to effective usage can be categorized into two main issues: first, a lack of awareness among scientists regarding the availability and capabilities of these resources, and second, a scarcity of supporting expertise in computing resources, which limits the ability of researchers to leverage these tools effectively. The Principal Investigator (PI) and co-Principal Investigator (co-PI) have already conducted preliminary interviews with various individuals engaged in the field of scientific computing; however, this initial evidence is deemed insufficient to draw broad conclusions, highlighting the necessity for further investigation to ascertain whether these observations hold true across a wider demographic. One of the central tasks of this project is to rigorously test these hypotheses to gather more conclusive data. Should our hypotheses be validated through our research, we intend to construct our category I proposal around the creation and development of innovative tools and methods designed to address and rectify these identified issues. Conversely, if our hypotheses are not supported by the findings, we will pivot our focus towards developing alternative explanations for the primary challenges currently confronting scientific computing in the United States.",

Generate metadata, including lineage/provenance: Datasets must be annotated with descriptive information, including their origin and any preparation done (cleaning, etc.), in order to be considered for re-use by other scientists than the ones that originally created it. Workflow Management: Tools to help scientists create, track, and execute complex data analysis pipelines, including integration with popular scientific workflows and platforms. Identify Architectures that can Scale: Even if tools exist that address all identified needs, such tools need to be integrated into a coherent architecture that maximizes resource use and facilitates collaboration and coordination of multiple working groups, distributed across the whole country.",
